Remember for costom middleware 
write under kernal protected middleware and add StartSession class as well

        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,

as we are going to use Sessions
add your costom middleware class as well

Name middleware and use the name in routes

to create multiple entries use insert instead of create in seeder
